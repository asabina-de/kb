# Architecture Decision Records Archive

Move superseded or deprecated decisions here when:

- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer approach
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer relevant to current architecture
- **Consolidated**: Multiple decisions merged into single new decision

Maintain the same naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.decision-title.md`

Always reference superseded decisions in new decisions for context.
