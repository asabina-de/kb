## Sample Decisions

### 2024-12-15 - State Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use React Context + useReducer for application state management instead of external libraries like Redux or Zustand.

**Context**: The application needed centralized state management for user authentication, theme preferences, and notification system. Team wanted to minimize external dependencies while maintaining predictable state updates.

**Rationale**: 
- Built-in React solution reduces bundle size
- Team already familiar with React patterns
- Application state complexity doesn't justify Redux overhead
- TypeScript integration works seamlessly with Context API

**Implementation**: 
```typescript
// AppContext.tsx
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  notifications: Notification[];
}

const AppContext = createContext<{
  state: AppState;
  dispatch: Dispatch<AppAction>;
}>({});

// Usage in components
const { state, dispatch } = useContext(AppContext);
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced bundle size by ~50KB (Redux + middleware)
- Simplified state debugging with React DevTools
- Better TypeScript inference
- Familiar patterns for React developers

**Trade-offs**:
- Manual optimization needed for performance
- No time-travel debugging
- Custom middleware required for async actions
- Limited ecosystem compared to Redux

**Future Considerations**:
- Monitor performance as component tree grows
- Consider Redux if complex async state patterns emerge
- Document state update patterns in [GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md)
