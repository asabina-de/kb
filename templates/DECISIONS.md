# Architecture Decision Records

This document chronicles **finalized architectural decisions** that have been thoroughly considered and chosen. Many decisions start as explorations in [DESIGN_NOTES.md](./DESIGN_NOTES.md) and graduate here when mature.

## Decision Lifecycle

**From exploration to decision:**

1. **Explore** alternatives and iterate in DESIGN_NOTES.md
2. **Mature** the design through examples and trade-off analysis
3. **Graduate** to this document with full decision context
4. **Leave breadcrumb** in DESIGN_NOTES.md pointing to final decision

**Decision versioning:**

- Use numbered files: `01-decision-name.md`, `02-next-decision.md`
- When superseding: move old decision to `ARCHIVE/` directory
- New decision gets next sequential number and references superseded decision
- Maintain continuous numbering (no reuse of numbers)

**Each decision entry should include:**

- What was decided and why
- What alternatives were considered
- Trade-offs and implications
- Implementation guidance
- Reference to any superseded decisions

## Sample Decisions

### 2024-12-15 - State Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use React Context + useReducer for application state management instead of external libraries like Redux or Zustand.

**Context**: The application needed centralized state management for user authentication, theme preferences, and notification system. Team wanted to minimize external dependencies while maintaining predictable state updates.

**Rationale**:

- Built-in React solution reduces bundle size
- Team already familiar with React patterns
- Application state complexity doesn't justify Redux overhead
- TypeScript integration works seamlessly with Context API

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// AppContext.tsx
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  theme: "light" | "dark";
  notifications: Notification[];
}

const AppContext = createContext<{
  state: AppState;
  dispatch: Dispatch<AppAction>;
}>({});

// Usage in components
const { state, dispatch } = useContext(AppContext);
```

**Benefits**:

- Reduced bundle size by ~50KB (Redux + middleware)
- Simplified state debugging with React DevTools
- Better TypeScript inference
- Familiar patterns for React developers

**Trade-offs**:

- Manual optimization needed for performance
- No time-travel debugging
- Custom middleware required for async actions
- Limited ecosystem compared to Redux

**Future Considerations**:

- Monitor performance as component tree grows
- Consider Redux if complex async state patterns emerge
- Document state update patterns in [GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md)

**Related Documentation**:

- [DESIGN_NOTES.md](./DESIGN_NOTES.md) - State schema definitions
- [GUIDELINES.md](./GUIDELINES.md) - Context usage patterns
