## Status Guide

- **Draft**: Initial ideas and brainstorming
- **Active**: In progress with ongoing iteration
- **Implemented**: Working solution deployed, may still evolve
- **Stable**: Mature implementation, minimal changes expected
- **Completed**: Finalized design ready for decisions/ graduation
- **Deprecated**: Abandoned for better alternative

## Completion Paths

- **Path A - Graduate to ADR**: Design-before-implementation approach where early design scribbles mature into formal, immutable architectural decisions
- **Path B - Standalone Documentation**: Keep as living implementation documentation that evolves with the system

## Document Nature

- **Design Notes**: Living, evolving documents that capture ongoing observations and iterations
- **Decision Records**: Immutable snapshots of formal decisions made at specific points in time
