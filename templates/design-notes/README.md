# Design Notes Directory

This directory contains **individual design exploration files** to avoid git worktree conflicts when working on multiple design concerns simultaneously.

## Getting Started

1. **Copy template**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD.design-note-template.md` as your starting point
2. **Name your file**: Use format `YYYY-MM-DD.topic-name.md`
3. **Iterate**: Develop ideas within individual files (no merge conflicts!)
4. **Graduate**: Move mature designs to `DECISIONS.md` with full rationale
5. **Archive**: Move completed explorations to `ARCHIVE/` directory

## Examples

- `2024-01-15.user-authentication.md`
- `2024-01-22.data-sync-strategy.md`
- `2024-02-03.performance-optimization.md`
