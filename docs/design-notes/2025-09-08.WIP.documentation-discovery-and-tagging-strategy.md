# Design Note: Documentation Discovery and Tagging Strategy

**Date:** 2025-09-08
**Status:** Work-in-Progress

## 1. Context

This knowledge base relies on a set of markdown files for documentation, including `design-notes/` and `decisions/`. A key challenge is the discovery of related documents, especially for topics that are cross-cutting concerns (e.g., a design that impacts both API design and authentication).

The goal is to establish a system that allows both human developers and automated agents to easily find contextually related documents with minimal friction for content creators.

## 2. Exploration

Several strategies were considered to solve the discovery problem:

### Strategy 1: Thematic Subdirectories

- **Description:** Organize notes into topic-specific subdirectories (e.g., `docs/design-notes/authentication/`).
- **Pros:** Provides a clear, browsable hierarchy.
- **Cons:** "Taxonomy is hard." It forces a single category onto a note, which is problematic for cross-cutting concerns. This friction could discourage documentation creation.

### Strategy 2: Symlinks or a README Index

- **Description:** Keep a flat file structure and create a separate index, either using symlinks in a `tags/` directory or by maintaining a list of links in a `README.md` file.
- **Pros:** Allows a note to be listed under multiple categories.
- **Cons:** Brittle. Renaming a file (e.g., changing its `[STATE]`) would break all symlinks or index entries pointing to it, creating a maintenance nightmare.

### Strategy 3: In-File Metadata (Front Matter)

- **Description:** Keep a flat file structure but embed metadata directly into the top of each markdown file using a YAML "front matter" block.
- **Pros:**
  - **Flexible Tagging:** A single note can have multiple tags, perfectly handling cross-cutting concerns.
  - **Robust:** The metadata lives with the content. Renaming the file does not break the taxonomy.
  - **Low Friction:** Creating a note remains simple. Adding tags is an easy, optional step.
  - **Agent & Tooling Friendly:** The metadata is structured and can be reliably parsed by scripts or tools like `grep`.
- **Cons:** Requires tools to parse the metadata for discovery (though `grep` is a very simple and ubiquitous tool).

## 3. Recommendation

We will adopt **Strategy 3: In-File Metadata (Front Matter)** combined with a descriptive filename convention.

### A. Filename Convention

All documents in `docs/design-notes/` and `docs/decisions/` will follow this pattern:

`YYYY-MM-DD.[STATE].description.md`

- **`YYYY-MM-DD`**: The date of creation, for chronological sorting.
- **`[STATE]`**: The current status of the document.
  - `TODO`: Work has not yet started.
  - `WIP`: Actively in progress.
  - `DONE`: The note is stable and the exploration is complete.
- **`description.md`**: A kebab-case description of the topic.

### B. Front Matter Convention

Each file will contain a YAML front matter block at the top.

- **`title`**: A human-readable title for the document.
- **`tags`**: A list of relevant tags (in lowercase) to aid discovery.

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: "Documentation Discovery and Tagging Strategy"
tags: [documentation, discovery, meta, tagging]
---
```

### C. Discovery Mechanism

The primary discovery mechanism will be using `grep` to search the front matter across all files.

**Example (Find notes tagged `authentication` or `api-design`):**

```bash
grep -lE '''tags:.*(authentication|api-design)''' docs/design-notes/*.md
```

This approach provides a robust, flexible, and low-friction system for creating and discovering knowledge base documents.
