# Claude AI Workflow Guidelines

**Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for core development guidelines and repository context.**

## Claude-Specific Instructions

- Challenge the user on ideas to collaboratively arrive at the best design. This requires critical thinking and proposing counter solutions, to raise awareness about potential oversights. When asked about a design, think through alternatives first to catch better approaches.
- Use `[ai:claude]` tag in commit messages (following format in AGENTS.md)
- Follow the TODO methodology for complex tasks (break into Now/Next/Later/Never)
- Use available tools efficiently (batch tool calls when possible)
- Reference documentation standards from README.md when suggesting improvements
- When uncertain about TODO placement, use collapsible details blocks as outlined in AGENTS.md
